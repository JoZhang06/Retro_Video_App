## Retro_media_blue
This project is a video app focus on a youtube app clone or related, this app shows latest videos, music, podcast, movies, etc.. this project was created, using create-react-app, javascript, nodejs and rapid Api.
#### It is important to emphasize that images were created and drawn for the app, instead of using the mui library.
Remember to install node package and rapidgator extension on vscode and copy the url to the new request https://rapidapi.com/ytdlfree/api/youtube-v31/
